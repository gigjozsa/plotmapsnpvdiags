## Scripts to generate and plot maps and PV diagrams
    pvdiags.py: Wrapper around aplpy to produce nice images, including image mosaics and PV diagrams from images and cubes. Contains an example script, too.

    primitive_cutout: Read in infile, cut to size either given by tempfile or ramax, ramin, demax, demin
